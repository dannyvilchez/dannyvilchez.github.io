Hey, I’m Danny and I'm a self-taught Data Engineer. I work mostly with data systems in finance and insurance, but my real joy comes from tinkering with open source tools, chasing odd ideas, and turning them into side projects.

Outside of code, you’ll find me running, lifting, strumming guitars, or trying to convince myself that picking up a fifth language is a good idea.

I like side quests. This blog is one of them.
