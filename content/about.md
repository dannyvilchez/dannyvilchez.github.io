Hey, I’m Danny — a self-taught Data Engineer who builds cool (and occasionally functional) things. I've worked mostly with data systems in finance and insurance, but my real joy comes from tinkering with open source tools, chasing odd ideas, and turning them into side projects that I'm 99% sure I’ll finish eventually.

Outside of code, you’ll find me running, lifting, strumming guitars, or trying to convince myself that picking up a fifth language is a good idea.

I like side quests. This blog is one of them.
